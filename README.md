### Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will
not discuss here). This function implements a cache for the inverse 
of a matrix.
